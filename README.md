Spring Boot Application with OpenAPI Specifications
This is a README file for a Spring Boot application that uses OpenAPI specifications. The application is built using the Spring Boot framework and utilizes the power of OpenAPI to define, document, and implement RESTful APIs.

Features
Exposes RESTful APIs based on OpenAPI specifications
Automatic API documentation generation
Request validation using OpenAPI schema
Interactive API documentation with Swagger UI
Easy integration with third-party tools and libraries that support OpenAPI

Prerequisites
Before running this application, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
Apache Maven (for building and running the application)

Getting Started
To get started with this Spring Boot application, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd <project_directory>
Build the application using Maven:

Copy code
mvn clean install
Run the application using Maven:

arduino
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
Once the application is running, you can access the APIs using the provided base URL (usually http://localhost:8080).

OpenAPI Specifications
This application utilizes OpenAPI specifications (formerly known as Swagger) to define the RESTful APIs. The OpenAPI specification file, typically named openapi.yaml or openapi.json, can be found in the project's root directory.

To view and interact with the API documentation, you can use the Swagger UI or other similar tools. Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI at the following URL:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
Configuration
The application can be configured using the application.properties file, located in the src/main/resources directory. You can modify this file to change various configuration settings such as the server port, database connection details, and more.

Dependencies
This Spring Boot application relies on the following dependencies:

Spring Boot Starter Web: for building web applications using Spring MVC.
Spring Boot Starter Data JPA: for working with databases using the Java Persistence API (JPA).
Spring Boot Starter Validation: for request validation using annotations.
Springfox Swagger UI: for rendering the OpenAPI documentation in an interactive UI.
These dependencies are defined in the pom.xml file in the project's root directory and are automatically resolved and downloaded by Maven.
